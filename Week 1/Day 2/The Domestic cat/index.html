    <h1>The lions</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and
      savannahs, but is absent in dense forests.<br />
      It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts
      to being active at night and at <br />
      twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and
      cubs. Prides vary in size and <br />
      composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey
      availability. Females cooperate when <br />
      hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer,
      buffalo, zebra and even giraffe
